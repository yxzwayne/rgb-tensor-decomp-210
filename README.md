Running dsc210_final_SOTA_Tuckers.ipynb

There are two paths you need to specify. 
- PATH is the path to a large image, which is large_image.jpg in the github
- PATH2 is the path to a smaller image, which we used stl.jpg for in github

Once these are specified you can run all and the file should have no errors.
